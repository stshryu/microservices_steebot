# Microservices Steebot

An exercise in creating small lightweight microservices.

## Setup

Run `docker-compose up --build` and the project will spin up the required services.

In the future, there will be an option to selectively spin up services to make testing easier. 

## Project Layout

`client/` contains the frontend.

`server/` contains the backend services.
