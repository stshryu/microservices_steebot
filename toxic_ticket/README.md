# Basic User and Toxic Ticket functionality

Stores a user, and their toxic ticket count.

## TODO 

Eventually, we want this server to standalone for users and toxic tickets.

We want to add: Toxic Ticketed Events, to allow for reasons for ticket issuance as well as tying the issuing officer and the perpretrator to the model object.
